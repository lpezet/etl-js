## (11/25/2019) Plugin Architecture, Clean end

### Plugin Architecture

See example of plugin architecture here:
https://github.com/release-it/release-it/blob/v11/docs/plugins/README.md
https://github.com/release-it/release-it/blob/0b5cb1a6298cc470c984e387bec845c4b46596f6/lib/plugin/factory.js

Basically:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "release-it": "*",
    "release-it-bar": "*"
  },
  "release-it": {
    "github": {
      "release": true
    },
    "plugins": {
      "release-it-bar": {
        "key": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We could do something like:

```json
    {
    	"dependencies": }
    		"etl-js": "*",
    		"my-etl-js-plugin": "*"
    	}
    }
```

And then in the ETL template:

```yaml
mods:
	- my-etl-js-plugin
etl:
	- step1
step1:
	my-etl-js-plugin:
		# ...
	# ...
```

It's a bit awkward to mix custom stuff and "reserved" stuff. For example, we need to make sure mods name do not conflict with "etl", "etlSet", and "mods" (if we use it). Maybe look for a different structure?

Idea one: turn "etl" into the container for steps for etl. Like so:

```yaml
mods:
	- lpezet@something
	- commands
	- file
etlSets:
	mySet1:
		- step1
etl:
	step1:
		lpezet@something:
			...
	step2:
		...
```

Note on plugins/mods: maybe enforce namespace in modules. Those without are built-in (e.g. commands, files, etc.). Custom ones must be with namespace (e.g. lpezet@my-etl-js-plugin) or an error (or WARNING?) is thrown.

Note: we could avoid the "mods" block and simply load on the fly the module if not built-in:

    1. if key not in built-in-command-names,
    2. load = ( key ) => try { require( key ); } catch (e) { .... }
    3. load( key )
    3. else use built-in-commands[ key ]

Look into this too:
https://github.com/release-it/release-it/blob/9be76397d8b1aa17e5b606db871ed75538990a20/lib/tasks.js

Might want to use it with say hpcc-cluster to add etl-js as a plugin.

### Clean end

I like how clean it ends:
https://github.com/release-it/release-it/blob/v11/bin/release-it.js

```js
release(options).then(
  () => process.exit(0),
  () => process.exit(1)
);
```
