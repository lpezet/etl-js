## (06/02/2020) Platform Abstraction

### Problems

#### writeFile()

Problems are:

- path may not work across platforms. Client need to handle this
- temp files are difficult to manage that way
- outputs of certain commands rely on paths too. See example below.

```json
"root": {
  "summary_{{ year }}": {
    "cluster": "thor",
    "content": "OUTPUT({{ year }});",
    "output": "/tmp/{{ year }}/test.csv"
  }
}
```

Solutions:

- `TODO` Handle path translation automatically. Assumption is to use POSIX style by default, although we could try to detect the type of path and translate accordingly.

- `TODO` Commands should rely on Executors utility methods (to be provided) in order to resolve "paths". So for instance, the "output" in the example above, should be handled by the command using Executor's function to resolve that path, depending on the platform.

#### download files

Problems are:

- Some widely used commands are not cross-platform compatible. For example: wget, curl.

Solutions:

- Provide new method `download()` to help with that.

#### custom (cross-platform) methods

Problem: Trying to help with cross-platform support we _want_ to add methods in Executor interface. This would make things no longer backward compatible.

Solution: Provide a Base implementation so if used, default implementations will be provided so Clients don't have to update code.
