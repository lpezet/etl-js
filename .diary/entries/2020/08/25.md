## (08/25/2020) Google APIs (New Mod)

Use API Key instead of OAuth2/OpenID for now. Resumable process is still a (big) work in progress.
Make "google-apis" mod work with API Key first, then look into OAuth2.

Actually, it looks like for Google Sheets API, API Key credentials are not possible. It MUST be through OAuth2 Keys only...

### Google Sign In.

Check cue-me-in (although I believe it uses ReactJS stuff...) and this:
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/javascript-implicit-flow

The idea would be to have an interactive ETL process, where user would login for the ETL process to update stuff on behalf of user (in user's Google account...like say create or update a spreadsheet).

```yml
root:
  google-apis: ...something...
```

The GoogleAPIsMod would initiate login process if token not present already.
Idea: could create a variable and ask ETL process to save state before exiting.
`TODO`: storing application settings is more for `etl-js-cli`, but `etl-js` should be able to store its `state`...somehow...
