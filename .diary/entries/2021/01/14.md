## (01/14/2021) Executor & Frictionless

### Executor

Maybe each Mod allow user to specify different Executor?
For example, some Commands could be executed remotely, some locally.

## Frictionless (New Mod?)

Mod to handle data with Metadata.
Look further down for "Thoth Metadata".

We can use Frictionless datapackages (e.g. https://github.com/frictionlessdata/examples/blob/master/inflation/), and create a Mod to handle datapackage.json.
For example:

```yml
root:
  frictionless:
    inflation_data:
      source: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/examples/blob/master/inflation/
      resource: inflation-gdp
      action: download
      target: /tmp/somefile.csv
  hpcc-sprays:
    "hello::inflation":
      source: /tmp/somefile.csv
      ...
```

Now it would be great if `frictionless` Mod would handle the configuration for other Mods, like `hpcc-sprays` and such.
For example:

```yml
root:
  frictionless:
    inflation_data:
      source: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/examples/blob/master/inflation/
      resource: inflation-gdp
      actions:
       - download: /tmp/somefolder/or/file.txt
       - load:
           hpcc-sprays:
             key: "helo::toto::titi"
             someother_hpcc_sprays_specific_config: something
           ...
       - transform:
           hpcc-ecls:
             key: "helo::toto::titi"
```

For the `load`, Frictionless Mod would provide the configuration for `hpcc-sprays`.
Would that work with current implementation of ETL-JS?
Can a Mod call another Mod????

What would be best maybe is to just have a Frictionless HPCC Mod instead. It would simplify development.
Might look like this:

```yml
root:
  hpcc-frictionless:
    inflation_data:
      source: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/examples/blob/master/inflation/
      logicalFilenamePrefix: "frictionless::examples::inflation"
      targetDir: /var/lib/HPCCSystems/mydropzone/frictionless
      resources:
        - inflation-gdp
        - inflation-consumer-gdp
```

This `hpcc-frictionless` Mod would 1) download the data files (some conventions or use targetDir value for where to put those files), 2) load the files into HPCC with the convention `logicalFilenamePrefix::resource_name::raw`, and 3) create new logical file `logicalFilenamePrefix::resource_name::pressed` (like olive oil) with the schema from datapackage.json.
