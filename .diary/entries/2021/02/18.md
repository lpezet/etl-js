# (02/18/2021) New architecture

Working on re-coding ETL.
Work started in "rearch" (re-architecture) folder(s) (including in tests/).

Tests for etl.ts pass except:

- skip
- exit
- events (commented those out in new activity.ts)
- modThrowingError (no idea, haven't looked at it)
- subActivities (those tests have actually been commented out)

For `skip` and `exit`, we need to revisit the control flow.

Here's an example of what we may want to do:

```yml
activity1:
  step1:
    # CONTINUE
    # Continue to the next step, if any.
    # This is most likely the most common usecase.
  step2:
    # STOP
    # Do not go to next step and terminate this activity.
    # This is most likley a very common usecase. For example, check at the beginning on an activity if something has been done already.
    # If so, skip the rest of the steps.
    #
    # Another usecase is when a step is waiting for feedback/input from user or another separate process.
    # State could be shared and stored by process and re-loaded before next run. It's up to ETL to skip steps that were done before and re-run the step where we stopped at before.
    # HOWEVER, STOP does not necessarily mean that the process wants to resume at that step/activity next run.
    # Maybe in this case then it's more like a PAUSE than a STOP?
  step3:
    # EXIT.
    # This might happen if Mod wants to make sure the process is really stopped.
    # Most likely due to an error. This does not only terminate this activity, but also all subsequent activities.
  step4:
    # JUMP
    # Go to another step (e.g. step 5, or even step 1!).
    # WARNING: I'm not sure about that one. This is a very advanced and most likely rare usecase
    # The problem with the implementation of that step is that it requires more than just one attribute/result (next step AND which step(s)).
    # It's possible the JUMP in most likely to another activity and not a step (step is like "files", "commands", etc. not very meaningful in itself).
    # In this case then, it's more like BRANCHING then. Dynamic routes so to speak...
  step5:
    # REPEAT
    # Repeat this step. I think this might be a rare usecase as well...should be easy to implement though.
    # Properties at the Activity level might control the maximum number of retries. Or even provide supervision (Supervisor pattern).
  step6:
    # ...
```

Another thought is `dynamic flow`. We can do sub-activities, which in essance changes the flow but require the Mod to (re)create those new activities/steps.
The `dynamic flow` is more about using the already defined steps/activities and only referring to those.
For example, in a given run, a Mod might decide to run `activity2,activity4`, then in another run just `activity5`. This seems close to the JUMP idea from the YAML above.

One idea for flows, and more generally on how to handle activities, is to use a STACK.
After resolving the `etlSet` we need to go through, we would add them, in proper order, to the STACK.
In essense, we would have the followins in ETL:

- `STACK`: could also be called `FLOW` here. Basically, we populate the stack initially with all the activity `keys`, then pop an activity (its key, then get the template for the activity), execute it, and then pop another etc. until stack is empty (or error thrown).
- `Activities`: This is basically what we have today: the template which specify the steps and other properties for each activity.

The idea here is that, an `activity` could push another activity (either in front, or in the back) to the `stack` to be run accordingly.
A usecase might be that, if a step/activity detects that something is missing, the activity might request to run that activity to install say prerequisites.
A more advanced usecase might have an activity PAUSE itself, run the new activity to setup prerequisites for example, then RESUME itself...

Now at this stage, HOW activities/steps CAN CONTROL THE FLOW?
For example, how can I run a `command` and, based on output (could use var), change the flow if need be?
Maybe a `FlowMod`???? (bad idea mate)

```yml
activity1:
  commands:
    001_check_install:
      command: "rpm -qa something && echo Yes || echo No"
      var: installed
  flows:
    ????:
      expression: "$vars.installed == 'Yes'"
      true:
        addFirst: "activity9" # here we would push to the STACK "activity9"
        #addLast: "someactivity" # just another example
      # implicitly false does nothing here
```

Here the FlowsMod needs a boolean expression, and specifications for TRUE and/or FALSE (nothing to do nothing).
PROBLEM: because of those unique keys within each activity, we can't have more than 1 _flows_ here.
HOW TO SOLVE THAT?
`IDEA #1`: We could have Mod handle entries where their key is the prefix. For example, CommandsMod could handle commands1, commands2, commands_3.
Problem is what happens when mods have composite words? Like image-magic...could the ImageMod handle image-magic over the ImageMagicMod????
`IDEA #2`: we could then introduce STEP, like we have ACTIVITY.
For example:

```yml
activity1:
  step1:
    commands:
      command: something
    files:
      "/tmp/toto": ...
  step2:
    flows: ...
  step3:
    commands: ...
```

The problem here is that it makes it very verbose and in some cases ridiculous, especially if we either:

- have only 1 Mod per step (e.g. step1 is commands, step2 is files, step 3 is something else, etc.)
- put everything under one step (step1)

`IDEA #3`: Could we have a special keyword to wrap things up a bit?
For example:

```yml
activity1:
  commands: ....
  wrap1:
    files: ....
    commands: ...
  files: ....
```

Here `wrap` could embed anything and here we end up having 2 sets of commands and 2 sets of files under the same activity.
