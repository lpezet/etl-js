### New Control Flow Approach(es) (better mate)

Thinking about adding to existing `Mod` interface hooks like "onError", "onSuccess".

```yml
etlSets:
  default:
    - activity1
    - activity2
activity1:
  step1:
    something: "something"
    onError: continue|stop|exit|goto
    onSuccess: continue|stop|exit|goto
  step2:
    somethingelse: "somethingelse"
activity2:
  step1:
    some: "some"
```

Another approach is to define all those activities as standalone elements, and literally "graph it out" using more definitions.

For example:

```yml
etlSets:
  default:
    init: activity1
    # edge definition style
    edges:
      - from: activity1
        to: actitity2
        condition: success
      - from: activity1
        to: actitity3
        condition: error
      - from: activity1
        to: actitity4
        condition: [$mvar === "toto"]

    # Above is too verbose and hard to read. How about this instead?
    nodes:
      - ref: activity
        when:
          - condition: status === "error"
            next: activity3
          # would that even work in yaml????
          - condition: status === "success" && ($myvar === "toto")
            next: activity4
          - condition: true # or maybe even skip condition:
            next: activity1 # default case
    # Generic onError to be used if not specified for a given activity
    onError: continue|stop|exit|goto
activity1:
  step1:
    something: "something"
    onError: continue|stop|exit
    onSuccess: continue|stop|exit
  step2:
    somethingelse: "somethingelse"
activity2:
  step1:
    some: "some"
```
