## (11/10/2021) Fixing/Improving mysqls mod

Need to work on implementation of `mysqls` mod.

### Password (security)

User's password should be stored in ~/.my.cnf like so:

```
[client]
password=my_password
```

And protect it using `chmod 600 ~/.my.cnf`.

Or another way is to store it in any file and pass that as argument to mysql client, like so:

```bash
mysql --defaults-file=/somewhere/my_mysql.conf
```

For more details, see:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/password-security-user.html

### Behavior

Right now the behavior is to create a file based on the key provided in the template.
For example:

```yaml
step1:
  mysqls:
    here_is_something:
      db_name: test
      execute: CREATE table test(id INTEGER);
```

Here, the current implementation will try to create the file `here_is_something`.
The intent here is not to output results in a file, but just to execute SQL code.
Need to change implementation to allow for both.

Ideas:

- Scheme

```yaml
step1:
  mysqls:
    "file:here_is_something":
      db_name: test
      execute: CREATE table test(id INTEGER);
```

- Option

```yaml
step1:
  mysqls:
    here_is_something:
      db_name: test
      execute: CREATE table test(id INTEGER);
      output: /tmp/myfile.csv
```

The "Option" way is the way to go.
