```js
const { ETL, Local, CommandsMod } = require("@lpezet/etl-js");
var template = {
  myETLActivity: {
    commands: {
      say_hello: {
        command: "printf 'hello world!'"
      }
    }
  }
};
var myETL = new ETL(new Local());
new CommandsMod().register(myETL);

myETL.process(template);
```

Or with TypeScript:

```ts
import { ETL, Local, CommandsMod } from "@lpezet/etl-js";
const template: any = {
  myETLActivity: {
    commands: {
      say_hello: {
        command: "printf 'hello world!'"
      }
    }
  }
};
const myETL = new ETL(new Local());
new CommandsMod().register(myETL);

myETL.process(template);
```

# Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Node.js 0.10 or higher is required.

Installation is done using the [`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```bash
$ npm install @lpezet/etl-js
```

# Features

    * Template-based process (JSON, YAML) to express steps and activities as part of ETL
    * Extensible behavior via mods
    * Tags allowing more dynamic behavior through activities and mods.

# Concept

ETL-JS has been born from the need to script different activities as part of simple yet important extract, load, and transform processes.
The idea is to be able to share and easily repeat activities over and over as needed, and leverage existing tools as much as possible.

An ETL template is basically composed of an _etl_ (legacy) or _etlSets_ and its activities as such:

```yml
etlSets:
  default:
    - activity1
    - activity2
activity1:
  step1:
    something: "something"
  step2:
    somethingelse: "somethingelse"
activity2:
  step1:
    some: "some"
```

Each _activity_ contains _step_ handled by [Mods](#mods). Each _mod_ can contain additional step within them.
Templates can also simply contain a single activity, as shown earlier in the introduction.
Something like this will therefore suffice:

```yml
activity1:
  step1:
    something: "something"
  step2:
    somethingelse: "somethingelse"
```

# Security

Commands, scripts and more can be executed as part of the Mods defined in the template. Therefore, you should make sure to use only the Mods you trust in your ETL Template.

# Usage

The quickest way to get started is to use ETL-JS via command line, with [`ETL-JS CLI`](https://github.com/lpezet/etl-js-cli).

Install the executable:

```bash
$ npm install -g @lpezet/etl-js-cli
```

Initialize process:

```bash
$ etl-js init
```

Edit `settings.yml`, to specify the type of executor to use:

```yml
etl:
  executor: local1

executors:
  local1:
    type: local
```

Create ETL template, hello.yml:

```yml
etlSets:
  default:
    - step1
    - step2
step1:
  commands:
    orion_pic:
      command: printf "orion-nebula-xlarge_web.jpg"
      var: "picture"
step2:
  files:
    /tmp/orion-nebula.jpg:
      source: https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/{{ vars.picture }}
```

This ETL template makes use of tags, which will be explained a little later.
WARNING: This template will effectively download a JPG file. Open it as your own risk.

Run template:

```bash
$ etl-js run hello.yaml
```

## Mods

Mods are features of the ETL template. They execute code, download files, import data into MySQL database, etc.
The idea is to leverage as much as possible of the existing and be as efficient as possible.
For more details, see the [Mods](Mods.md) page.

## Control Flow

Mods can decide whether to **skip** the remaining steps for a given activity, or even terminate (**exit**) the process.
Use cases can be:

- Mod detects that no new data has been found, decides to exit the ETL process.
- Mod detects that data didn't change and decides not to continue the current activity of doing work already done before

It's up to Mods to expose that functionality. For example, the **Commands Mod** expose the following properties:

```yml
skip_on_test_failed: true|false
exit_on_test_failed: true|false
```

## Tags

Tags can be used to make the process more dynamic. You might want your ETL process to start with a step figuring out which files to ingest (e.g. only new ones). And you would want the next step to download those files and only those files.
This means that, at the time of writing your ETL template, you do not know which files will be processed.
That's where tags come in.
You have seen those tags already in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section. Here it is again:

```yml
etlSets:
  default:
    - step1
    - step2
step1:
  commands:
    orion_pic:
      command: printf "orion-nebula-xlarge_web.jpg"
      var: file_to_download
step2:
  files:
    /tmp/orion-nebula.jpg:
      source: https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/{{ $.vars.file_to_download }}
```

The tag here is `{{ $.vars.file_to_download }}`. It basically refers to the `var` of the step1 command _orion_pic_.

The context used in tags is as follows:

```yml
vars:
	...vars go here...
env:
	...environment variables here from process.env.....
```

Here's another example using tags and making use of the `result_as_json` attribute of the `commands` mod. The `result` of the command will be parsed and stored as JSON instead of a string. This allows us to, for example, use the result as an array to download multiple files. The `files` mod will interpret that array and download multiple files.

```js
var template = {
  etlSets: {
    default: [ 'step1', 'step2' ]
  },
  step1: {
    commands: {
      "file_to_download": {
        command: "printf '[\"PIA08653/PIA08653~small.jpg\",\"PIA21073/PIA21073~small.jpg\"]'",
        result_as_json: true
        var: files_to_download
      }
    }
  },
  step2: {
    files: {
      "/tmp/{{ $.vars.file_to_download }}": {
        source: "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/{{ vars.files_to_download }}"
      }
    }
  }
};
```

In `step2`, the `files` mod is used to specify a dynamic file to download with tags. Each file stored in `files_to_download` variable, will be downloaded from `https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/` and stored in `/tmp/`.

## Events

ETL will emit some events during the ETL process.

- _activityDone( activityId, error, data, activityIndex, totalActivities )_ - An activity has been completed (with or without error). The **activityId** is the name of the activity as specified in the template, the **activityIndex** is the order number the activity has been executed and the **totalActivities** represent the total number of activities to be run.

## Results

##### _OBSOLETE: rework done, need doc to be updated. Advice is to NOT rely on Mod results, but use the Content with vars & env for tags._

The ETL `process()` method returns a Promise. Upon success, the data **resolved** will contain the results of the process and each activity.

Reusing the advanced template from the [Tags](#tags) section:

```js
var template = {
  etlSets: {
    default: [ 'step1', 'step2' ]
  },
  step1: {
    commands: {
      "file_to_download": {
        command: "printf '[\"PIA08653/PIA08653~small.jpg\",\"PIA21073/PIA21073~small.jpg\"]'",
        result_as_json: true
        var: files_to_download
      }
    }
  },
  step2: {
    files: {
      "/tmp/{{ vars.file_to_download }}": {
        source: "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/{{ vars.file_to_download }}"
      }
    }
  }
};
ETL.process( template ).then(function( pResults ) {
  console.log( util.inspect(pResults, false, null, true) );
});
```

, the result would be (some omission for brevity):

```js
{ etl: { exit: false },
  step1:
   { commands:
      { file_to_download:
         { error: null,
           result:
            [ 'PIA08653/PIA08653~small.jpg', 'PIA21073/PIA21073~small.jpg' ],
           message: null,
           exit: false,
           pass: true,
           _stdout:
            '["PIA08653/PIA08653~small.jpg","PIA21073/PIA21073~small.jpg"]',
           _stderr: '' } } },
  step2:
   { files:
      { '/tmp/PIA08653/PIA08653~small.jpg':
         { error: null,
